- polymorphism = where a sybclass is able to modify its superclass
- therefore some "virtual methods" can be defined and redefined in superclasses can cause the behaviour of superclass to change
- class behaviour can be changed by subclasses
- example
- "abstract method" shows an ability or potential, that is then actually instantiated later by one of the subclasses
- polymorphism halps keep code clean and simple
- "composition" is another way to build up classes that are adaptable and well designed
- "composition" = composing an object by using other objects, building up by block sof code that can be added together in different ways
-compare and contrast inheritance vs composition
- inheritance works by extending the focus and abilities of a class (the class or subclass gives all the fuctionality)
- compositinn works by using classes as building blocs and adding them together to get the desired functionality (each class or subclass only gives part of the functionality)
- inheritance - single inheritance is easier, more safe, higher maintainability compared to multiple inheriance

- try except blocks
- try, except, else, finally
- finally blocks will always execute no matter what happens in the previous blocks

- exceptions are class
- exceptions can be caught, to allow the exception class object to be analysed
- any subclasses can be iterated over by using the __subclasses__()  method
- easy to create and use custom made exceptions (subclasses from existing exceptios)
