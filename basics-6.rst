- python suitable for procedural and object based programming
- oop object oreiented programming
- objects have: name, individual properties, abilities to perform activties
- the large ficus tree grows quickly
- ficus = object name
- class = trees, or plants
- property = large
- activity = growth (quickly)

- methods are functions that are invoked from "within the data2, eg a class object or dataset can have a method that acts on it,  
- this contrasts to when data is "passed to" a function
- Procedural approach = seperate world of data, and world of code. Typically functions can use data, but data cant use functions.
- Object approach = both data and code are enclosed together in the same world, divided into classes

- Think of a class like a "recipe" - it can be used to create a useful "object" (by following the recipe) 
- Objects have traits = properties / attributes
- Every object has a set of traits and can perform a set of activites (methods)
- (module, file level function(), vs class.method)
- Objects are the incarnation of the ideas expressed within classes
- Properly constrcuted classes can prevent unauthorised or accidental misuse of data
- No clear boundary between data and code - they are combined togehter within objects
- 
- Classes (sub-classes) may be defined within an over-arching superclass 
- Class is a "set" of objects. Each object reflects the traits and qualitiies of its class. 
- Inheritance, anobject of one class with always inherit the traits, requirements and qualities of its superclasses

- All objects have: name, properties, activity
- OOP is essentially the art of designing, defining and expanding classes
- A class is simply a tool for creating relevant and suitable objects...
- Object is an instance of the class, created via instantiation


- Design plan - start with general and broad classes, then become more specific
