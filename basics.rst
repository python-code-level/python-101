Python basics (background for exam prep)

- Commands, Instruction list (IL) = complete set of the known commands
- similarities between natural languages and machine languages
- contains: alphabet, dictionary/lexis, syntax rules (is it valid?), semantic rules (does it make sense?)
- instruction list (IL) is similar concept to the machines "alphabet2
- high level programming languages help communicate between underlying basic commands and instruction list and human language
- machines execute machine code, but programs written for high-level programming language are "source code" and contained within a source file
- for program to work as expected and designed, needs correct commands / alphabet, correct lexix / dictionary, correct syntax, and correct seamtnically
- when ready for use, program needs to be rednered into machin elanguage
- two main methods to convert from hig-level programming language into machin elanguage - compilation and interpretation
