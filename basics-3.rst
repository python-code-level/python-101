string revision

- immutable
- any changes result in a new string, eg assigned to the same name
- use id() to show actual object id
- string operations include replication and concatenation
- in and not in, easily used to find matching characters within a string
- (similar to finding strings in a list)
- strings do not have an append method or insert, and cannot use del[index] to remove characters
- so, due ot imutability, any major edits, eg additions via concatenation will just result in a new copy of the string, new object id, 
- even if referred to by the same name 
- 
- q's = how to tell if multiple edits and re-working of new strings wil impact code efficiency?
